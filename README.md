# Car-Racing-Mini-Project


This project isn't a real game, as it doesn't have a specific object or goal. It is a small project that I have worked on to be able to learn more about game objects and how to manipulate them, the use of tile maps, reactive tiles, and overall programming of game objects. 

Just press start, and you will be able to control the racing car around the track as simple as that.
